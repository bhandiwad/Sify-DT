## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture Analysis**

Based on the codebase analysis, the system follows a modern React-based architecture with:

### **Frontend Stack**
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite** for build tooling and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **React Router** for client-side navigation

### **Component Architecture**
- **25+ React components** organized by functionality
- **Modular design** with reusable UI components
- **Custom hooks** for state management and business logic
- **Utility functions** for data processing and validation

### **Key Components Identified**
- `Dashboard.jsx` - Main dashboard with persona switching
- `NewProject.jsx` - Project creation and configuration
- `ExcelUpload.jsx` - File upload and processing
- `BoQGenerated.jsx` - Bill of Quantities generation and editing
- `PersonaSwitcher.jsx` - Role-based access control
- `ApprovalWorkflow.jsx` - Multi-stage approval process
- `ProductManagerReview.jsx` - Product manager workflow
- `SolutionArchitectVetting.jsx` - Technical validation workflow

### **Data Model Structure**
- **PERSONAS** - Account Manager, Product Manager, Solution Architect, Finance Admin
- **PROJECT_STATUS** - Draft, Pending Reviews, Approved workflow states
- **FLOW_TYPES** - Standard vs Custom workflow routing
- **CONTRACT_TERMS** - Monthly, Quarterly, Annual, 3-Year pricing
- **PRICE_BOOK_SKUS** - Comprehensive product catalog with internal codes
- **ESSENTIAL_SERVICES** - Auto-added compliance services

## üìä **Business Logic Analysis**

### **Workflow Engine**
The system implements a sophisticated state machine with:
- **Role-based permissions** controlling access to specific workflow stages
- **Automatic routing** based on SKU matching results
- **Multi-stage approvals** with proper handoffs between personas
- **Status tracking** throughout the entire process

### **SKU Matching Algorithm**
- **Rule-based engine** categorizes uploaded requirements
- **Standard items** match existing price book entries
- **Custom items** trigger approval workflows
- **Essential services** automatically added for compliance

### **Pricing Model**
- **Contract-based discounts** (Annual: 15%, 3-Year: 25%)
- **Volume pricing** with bulk resource calculations
- **GST calculations** and tax compliance
- **Real-time totals** with edit capabilities
